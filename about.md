I am currently a data science and teaching postdoctoral fellow with [The Living Data Project](https://www.ciee-icee.ca/ldp.html) based at the University of British Columbia. I'm also a marine ecologist broadly interested in the effects of environmental stressors on marine communities supported by foundation species (e.g. barnacles, mussels, algae). I am also passionate about teaching proper data management and reproducible workflows to undergraduates, so they don't make the same mistakes that I did when starting out in research. Outside of teaching and research, you can find me chasing around my two rugrats, Jasper and James.
